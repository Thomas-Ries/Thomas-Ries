### Hello and Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Thomas, a Front-End Web Developer and Iâ€™m currently working for a digital agency based in France. I really enjoy learning languages, frameworks like Vue.JS and React, increasing my skills and growing professionally by learning  new topicâ€™s such as Agileâ€™s methods or even pushing my knowledges to be a Full-Stack Web Developer. I also enjoy UI / UX and design in general.
